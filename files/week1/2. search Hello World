Search “Hello World”: 0 to search in less than 5 minutes


Take a few moments and try it yourself by logging into your OpenSearch instance
provided by the class and loading the flight data yourself (or try in your own environment by following the OpenSearch demo instructions).
One of the things you may find most surprising about this demo is how visual it is
as well as how most of it is powered by issuing queries to a search engine even though you as the end user
likely didn’t actually type in any keywords into the search box. If you’ve never built or worked with a search engine before,
this capability is at the heart of most modern search engines like Elasticsearch and Solr and is why they have become so popular as data stores.
